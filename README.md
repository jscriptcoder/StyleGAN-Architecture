# StyleGAN Architecture
Implementation of the different components that comprise StyleGAN architecture in PyTorch

## Introduction

StyleGANs are presented in [Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans) by [Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), course 2, [Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-better-generative-adversarial-networks-gans), week 3, and I've been literally blown away by the power of this state-of-the-art GAN, that not only is it able to generate extremelly realistic, high quality and high resolution images, but also by it's amazing ability to mix styles and control of features.
